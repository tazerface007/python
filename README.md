# Python Programming language

Python is a general-purpose, high-level, interpreted programming language.

- Guido van Rossum created python.
- Development of Python began in the late 1980s, and the first public release, Python 0.9.0, was in February 1991.
- Van Rossum created Python as a successor to the ABC language that could handle exception and interface with Amoeba operating system. He also wanted a language that was easy to read and could bridge the gap between low-level language (like C) and shell scripting.


## Basic & Unique Features of Python

### Basic Features
- **Interpreted**: Code is executed line by line, which makes debugging easier.
- **Dynamically Typed**: You don't need to declare the variables type (like integer, string, etc.).
- **High-level**: It abstract away complex computer architecture details, allowing programmers to focus on the problem.
- **Object-Oriented**: It supports OO Programming principles, allowing for code organization using classes and objects.
- **Extensive Standard Library**: Python comes with a large collection of pre-written modules for various tasks.

### Unique Features:
- **Readability (The "Zen" of Python)**: Its design uses simple English keywords and strictly enforced indentation (whitespace) instead of braces or semicolon, forcing clean, uniform style across projects.
- **Battries Included**: The phrase refers to its vast standard library, meaning youcan do a lot without downloading extra packages.
- **Interactive shell**: ALlows developers to test code snippets and explore functionality quickly.


## What's Differentiate Python?

|Feature|Python's Approach|Contrast with Language like C/Java|
|**Syntax**|Minimalist, using indentation for code blocks.| Uses braces ( {} ) and semicolons ( ; )|
|**Typing**|Dynamic (types checked at runtime)|Static (types checked at compile time).|
|**Ecosystem**|Strong focus
